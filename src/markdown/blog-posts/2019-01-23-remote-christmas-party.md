I have to say that I am surprised just how possible it is to make personal connections while working remotely. There are people who I've only seen a couple of times in "real life" (or even never!) but who I talk to on a daily basis.

They are great colleagues and I really enjoy their company.
That's why I was really excited when someone at Tes suggested to have a remote Christmas party.
It was so much fun! I wrote a blog post about it for the Tes Engineering blog.
Here [it is](https://engineering.tes.com/post/remote-christmas-party/).
