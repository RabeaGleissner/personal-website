Wow, maybe this should have been obvious but I didnâ€™t realise that until now. Thatâ€™s so cool!

Iâ€™m working on a slack bot and need to parse peopleâ€™s commands to the bot. So Iâ€™ll be dealing with a lot of strings - and knowing that pattern matching works for this data type is cool!!

You have to use the concatenation operators. 

```elixir
iex(1)> ex_string = "hello elixir"
"hello elixir"
iex(2)> "hello" <> language = ex_string
"hello elixir"
iex(3)> language
" elixir"
```

I guess itâ€™s like matching on a listâ€¦ you have the head and the rest.

So this one wonâ€™t work:

```elixir

iex(4)> greeting <> " elixir" = ex_string

```
