```javascript
Uncaught Error: Route.post() requires a callback function but got a [object Undefined]
```
What Express is trying to tell you is that your route is calling a controller function that doesnâ€™t existâ€¦ 
Because you renamed it in the controllerâ€¦ and then you went and updated some other thingsâ€¦ and then you forgot to rename the function in the routes file. Cool. ðŸ¤·
