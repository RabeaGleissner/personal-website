I think threads on Slack are great - they keep the channel a lot tidier.
It just always annoyed me that I couldn’t figure out which shortcut to use to close that little window on the right, that showed the threads view.
And I really dislike having that window open while reading conversations in other channels.
I need to close it after reading the threaded conversation!

So I finally made the effort to google it. (yes, sooo much effort!)
It’s `cmd + .` to toggle that right pane.
Which reminded me of an IntelliJ shortcut.
Didn't that same one open the preferences? 

I googled again - no, turns out that it's `cmd + ,` that opens the preferences.
Same as on Slack!
Hopefully I will remember this now that I’ve written about it.

[Edit... I first wrote this note on 26 July in Evernote and finally published this post today, on 24 September.
I didn't remember the shortcut!
But now that I've re-read.
I must remember it!
I think I'll set myself a Slack reminder in a week to see if I'm using the short cut or not.]
