Today my colleague Federico introduced me to the functional programming library of lodash. We were using `fp.compose`. 
Here’s how we used it:
We had a JavaScript object which first needed to be transformed into a different shape and then we needed to transform the result of that again, into data that our frontend could display.
With `fp.compose` we could pass it the two transformation functions and it would apply one after the other.

Without lodash fp.compose, it would be this:
`secondTransformation(firstTransformation(theData))`

With lodash fp.compose, we can do this:
`fp.compose(secondTransformation, firstTransformation)(theData)`

So that’s cool! I just found the order a bit counter intuitive. 

Luckily I came across `fp.pipe` which does the same thing but in the opposite direction. So the data flows from left to right.
`fp.pipe(firstTransformation, secondTransformation)(theData)`

I think that’s easier to understand.
Kind of like piping data through a list of functions in Elixir.
Or even piping in bash for that matter!
That’s probably something that most developers will be familiar with, so I feel more comfortable using the `fp.pipe` function in our code. Easier to understand!
