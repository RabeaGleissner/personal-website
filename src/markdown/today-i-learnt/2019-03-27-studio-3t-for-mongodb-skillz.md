Most of us at work seem to be using Studio 3T to access our data in MongoDB.
Here are a few things that I've learnt that help me use it better.

## Shell shortcut

To open the shell to write Mongo queries, click on the collection that you want to search and use `cmd+l`. 

## Query history

If you want to see the previous queries that you ran in one of the input boxes in the normal view, press `cmd + down-arrow`. A revelation!! So handy.

## Limit your query

If you want to see some example of data that is stored in certain keys or want to check certain records - make sure you limit the search query to 10 or so... otherwise it'll take forever when you have a big dataset.
