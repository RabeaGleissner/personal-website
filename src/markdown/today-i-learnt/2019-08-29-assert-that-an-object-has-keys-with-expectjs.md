Weâ€™re using expect.js at work for our test assertions.
And today I learnt that you can have an assertion on whether an object has a key or not. 
I needed to assert that an object was not saved with a certain key in our database.
So I was able to use `expect(savedObject).to.not.have.key('dates')` which was very handy!
